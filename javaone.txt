Transaction Lifecycle is defined to handle technical/timeout exceptions that are being encountered during transaction processing within SCPAY.

When ever there a technical/timeout exception encountered while processing the transaction with in the SCPAY, an event is generated and payload will be filled with all event status code details and pushed to the Event Bus handler.

The Event Bus listerner service will persist all these payload messages in to the database and later Replay service will attempt to replay these failed transactions(technically/timeout) periodically based on the configurable duration.


  Configuration:
  
    maven:
	
	msg:	
	
	datasource:
	
	
	queries.


The Replay Service performs the below operations.

  1. reply transaction by exceptions.
  
  2. reply transaction by timeouts.
  
  event is nothing but end-to-end transaction reference id or message id
